                    <p class="sub-title">Bernard Health • Nashville, TN</p>
                    <p class="sub-title">Software Development Team Member working on <b>BerniePortal</b>, an online all-in-one HR platform.</p>
                    
                    <div class="description--block">
                        <p class="title">Front end projects using <b>HTML5</b>, <b>CSS3</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>Vue.js</b>, <b>SASS</b>, <b>Gulp</b>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Implemented a much needed interface for the Client Success team to view and manage their client's accounts, as well as any other associated children accounts, from a single area.</li>
                            <li>Completed a UI overhaul of two product areas related to PDF and form mapping. This created a much more intuitive and concrete workflow for users mapping fields to PDFs.</li>
                            <li>Adapted the billing area to allow users to regenerate bills, and save up to three previous bill generations as downloadable PDFs and CSVs. This allowed users to correct mistakes without having to call in for support, inevitably pulling a developer away from their work to manually regenerate a bill.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="title">Full stack projects using <b>PHP</b>, <b>Laravel</b>, <b>MySQL</b>, and the aforementioned front end technologies.</p>
                        <p>• Created a new PDF field type that allows for the mapping of multiple choice questions. During benefit enrollment the questions are asked to each employee, with all answers mapping to an associated PDF.</p>
                        <p>• Realized a new feature that allows user creation of bnefit plan templates, which can be imported across multiple users and used to build out multiple plans with similar details. These built out plans update when the parent template is updated. This took a lot of stress off of users that needed several plans with nearly identical information. With this new feature they were able to simply create a plan template that could be used to fix mistakes or create plans with minor differences very easily.</p>
    
                        <p class="title">Day to day responsibilities:</p>
                        <p>• Utilize <b>Xdebug</b> and <b>Laravel logs</b> for debugging; <b>Git and Github</b> for version control; <b>Homestead</b> and <b>Vagrant</b> with <b>VirtualBox</b> to simulate our production environment locally; <b>iTerm2</b>; and <b>Sequel Pro</b> for database management.</p>
                        <p>• Update, refactor, and maintain legacy code consiting of <b>jQuery</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>PHP</b>, <b>Drupal</b>.</p>
                        <p>• Review code pull requests for local and remote teams.</p>
                        <p>• Mentoring and support for junior developers.</p>
                        <p>• Maintain mobile app written in <b>Objective-C</b>, and make sure any updates pass <b>iOS App Store Review</b>.</p>
